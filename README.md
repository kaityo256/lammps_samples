# LAMMPS Sample Files

## Overview

This repository provides sample files for visualizing simulation results generated by LAMMPS using VMD.

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

To get started, clone this repository by running the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kaityo256/lammps_samples.git
cd lammps_samples
```

### Running Simulations

The following sections describe how to run each simulation and visualize the results with VMD.

#### Collision Simulation

To run the collision simulation, use the commands below:

```sh
cd collision
python3 generate_config.py
lmp_serial < collision.input
```

This will generate the file `collision.lammpstrj`, which can be loaded into VMD for visualization.

#### Bubble Simulation

To execute the bubble simulation, run the following:

```sh
cd bubble
python3 generate_config.py
lmp_serial < bubble.input
```

The output file `bubble.lammpstrj` can be visualized with VMD.

#### Phase Separation Simulation
To perform the phase separation simulation, use these commands:

```sh
cd phase_separation
python3 generate_config.py
lmp_serial < phase_separation.input
```

This will create the file `phase_separation.lammpstrj`, which can be opened in VMD for visualization.
